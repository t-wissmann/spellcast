Did you spot the spelling misteke in this line? If you have aspell installed,
you can simply run the following:

    ./spellcheck-batch.py -- --lang=en < test.txt

There is not much more to see, because all the main work is done by the spell
checker, which is aspell by default. Hence, spellcheck-batch does not have a
separate wobsite but only some text documentation in the git repository.
